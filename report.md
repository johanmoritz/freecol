## Project

Name: FreeCol

URL: https://github.com/johanmoritz/freecol

An open-source turn-based strategy game based on Colonization. The goal of the game is to explore and colonize America. The game is written in Java, built with the `ant` build system and has been worked on continually by a group of contributers since 2002. It's currently on its `0.11.6` version.

## Onboarding experience

Did it build and run as documented?
    
See the assignment for details; if everything works out of the box,
there is no need to write much here. If the first project(s) you picked
ended up being unsuitable, you can describe the "onboarding experience"
for each project, along with reason(s) why you changed to a different one.


## Complexity

1. What are your results for ten complex functions?
   * Did all tools/methods get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### DYI

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

### Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional)

git diff ...

## Overall experience

What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?

Is there something special you want to mention here?
